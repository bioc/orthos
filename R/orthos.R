#' orthos - variance decomposition using conditional variational auto-encoders
#'
#' \pkg{orthos} decomposes RNA-seq contrasts, for example obtained from a
#' genetic or compound treatment experiments, into non-specific and
#' experiment-specific components. Original and decomposed contrasts can
#' be efficiently queried against a large database of public contrasts
#' (derived from ARCHS4, https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/) to identify similar
#' experiments. \pkg{orthos} furthermore provides plotting functions to
#' visualize the results of such queries for similar contrasts.
